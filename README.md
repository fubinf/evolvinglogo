# evolvinglogo: crowd-sourced evolution of a non-static logo

## Overview

A research project for evaluating how well the 
details of the non-static logo of a large organisation 
can be evolved (within a given base structure)
by automatically incorporating like/dislike feedback from the
organisation's members.

Non-static means 
a) the basic logo design describes an entire familiy of logos 
   (not just a single logo) by including some variable parameters and
b) the intended use of the logo is that those parameters are not
   fixed over a long time, but vary frequently (e.g. for each use or 
   once per day).

The research is performed by a combination of a software development with a 
field study.

The software development uses reinforcement learning on a parameterized
representation of all possible logos.

The field study uses the new (in 2023) logo of Freie Universität Berlin
as an example, which involves colored rectangular blocks in the background
that are variable.
